The app has two windows: one has the minesweeper game, where the user can left click on a tile to uncover it and right click to place (or remove) a flag, and the other displays an identical board, but where the probabilities of each tile being a mine, as deduced solely from information visible to the player, are shown. The user can create a new board of arbitrary size and of arbitrary difficulty with the button in the top right. The game shows the number of flags remaining in the bottom left corner.
